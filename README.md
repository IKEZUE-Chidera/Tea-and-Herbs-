The project involves building a website for a company called "Tea and Herbs." The layout will use CSS floats, despite the future preference for Flexbox or Grid, because understanding floats is still relevant in older codebases and job interviews.

The project includes various sections such as:
- **Hero Section**: With animations, like a bouncing button and animated headings.
- **Skills Section**: A four-column layout that reacts to user interactions with hover effects.
- **About Section**: A two-column layout with zoom and overlay effects on images.
- **Products Section**: A nested column layout for products.
- **Services Section**: Features cards with hover effects that resize and reposition icons.
- **Contact Section**: Uses Formspree for form submission without a backend.
- **Footer and Navbar**: Navigation across different pages, such as the "About" page.

The project is fully responsive, adapting layouts for both small and large screens, ensuring a good experience across devices. Finally, the project is deployed via Netlify, a free hosting service. The focus is on gaining hands-on experience with different CSS techniques.
